# UpDown
A nodejs based project that allows any user to check whether a certain website is up or down.
Every user can have 5 such websites and place the relevant checks for them.

A user can choose which statusCode defines a website as up and which one defines it as down.
As soon as the status of a website changes, we send an sms to the user informing him/her of the changed status of theier website.
